# Introduction:

My second Tech Academy Live Project was both an exercise in the Agile/Scrum method of Project Management and a great experience in diving into the inner workings of ASP.NET MVC and Entity Framework. I spent two weeks working with a team of fellow students in developing software designed for a theater company to manage its website content. 

Working with ASP.NET on a major project for the first time was an excellent learning opportunity to understand MVC & Entity Framework on a deeper level as well as experience in troubleshooting code that was written by other developers. I was requried to fix various bugs in the code and come up with solutions to a number of problems. 

Here you will find development stories related to my project with supporting code snippets.

## Styling Fixes:

Content on one of the pages that displayed details for theater's production details was not centering properly on smaller screens.
